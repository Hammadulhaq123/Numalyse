# How to Contribute?

Individuals interested in contributing to our software are encouraged to enhance the user experience by focusing on the design and layout of the website. Whether it's crafting a visually appealing interface or optimizing the layout for intuitive navigation, your creative input is highly valued. Additionally, you have the flexibility to make meaningful contributions in two distinct ways. You can either create complete functionalities, including the function's logic and frontend components, ensuring seamless rendering of data on the web pages. Alternatively, you can contribute by building specific functions that solve mathematical problems and submit a pull request. If the functionality meets the required standards and functions correctly, your work will be accepted, and the results will be integrated into the software. Your expertise and dedication can play a significant role in shaping the user experience and expanding the capabilities of our software.
